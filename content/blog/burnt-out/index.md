# Burnt out is not fun
**When you don't feel like developing or doing your normal hobby**

That may be a sign of burnt-out, but it usually lasts for a year or a few, depending on how hard you were on yourself. I was tough on myself in 2016 and earlier for about five years.

We are all human beings. We can only do this type of job with periodic breaks.

## Burnt out is very, very serious
You'll lose motivation to be on the computer doing your job, making **NO profit** with a missing spot on your resume, and it could fire back by decreasing your chances to make deals with clients when they see the blank spot on the resume.

### My opinion from being burnt out from designing and programming

Design is the more difficult on my brain because I have to be more creative than anyone else and create someone no one has done.

Programming is duller. You know what to write, you can copy and paste, you know where to go when errors come up, and somebody will sweep in and help you out for StackExchange points.

Design is not the same case as programming. You're alone in your design crew as a freelancer. There's nobody else helping you out. You could throw away mistakes and start over from scratch. I've done it many times. So at some point, I threw out ten designs for one project.

I've done both, programmers have a lesser chance of being burnt out than designers, but this is my opinion.

## How do I prevent myself from being burnt out?

1. **Pace yourself.** Work for 1-2 hours, then take 15 minutes to break away from the computer, then return to continue your work.
2. Go on a vacation if you can afford it; it will clear your head.
3. Do healthy activities like gym, yoga, biking, or anything.
4. Be in sync with the sun whenever possible, go to bed early, and wake up when the sun rises.

## If you're burnt out, what should I do?
It's too late at this point. You have to wait it out. While waiting it out, do healthy activities to improve yourself. Try to use your phone or computer sparingly in your power.

If you're a web developer, keep up to date with new technology sporadically (only if you have an interest.) Many front-end technologies have been shown up and popularized in the past decade.

## Thank you, and don't get burnt out!
Thank you for reading this article, and please start taking breaks when necessary (every 1-2 hours is a suggestion), or the time will come. Of course, you have yet to determine when it will come exactly, but it will eventually come if you're constantly forcing yourself.
