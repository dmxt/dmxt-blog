This is how you get your accomplishments and further your life. (If you make your bed daily, disregard this article.)

# Start off your day by making your bed

Once you wake up and got up, **make your bed**.  This is your first tiny task of the day. 

When this small task is completed, you will have accomplished the first task of the day.

It will give you a sense of pride and encourage you to complete to do another task. And another, and another. By the end of the day, you'll have many tasks completed!

If you cannot do little things right — you'll never be able to do **big** things right.

### At night time...

When you come back to the bed, you'll see the well-made bed, that **you** made! It will give you an encouragement and a small sense of pride.

Think about it, if you can't make your bed, then how can you complete more complex tasks during the day when you can't do little things like getting your bed done? You'll feel miserable and feel like you can't do anything small thing right.

### If you have a miserable day
And if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that was made. That **you** made! And a made bed will give you an encouragement that tomorrow will be better.

## Small task completed lead to more tasks completed

Small task, like making your bed, will give you a sense of accomplishment and pride. You'll have easier time to move on to doing more tasks during the day.

Now start making your bed when you wake up! 🛏️

**Credit:** I got this advice from a lieutenant commander in the military, applied it and it worked to the dot. Never skip making your bed, no matter what excuses are, do it. 😉
